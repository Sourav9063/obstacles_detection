# Obstacles detection for blind person
Using tensor flow we map the world in 3d. Then taking the center pixels value(near of far) we map it with device's Vibrator.
This allows a blind person to find his/her way.
When device detects objects near the camera, it vibrates for 200ms. Other wise it vibrates for 50ms.
